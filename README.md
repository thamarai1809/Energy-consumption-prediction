## Energy Consumption Prediction using LSTM ##

This project focuses on predicting energy consumption using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting tasks. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts future energy consumption based on historical data. 

The model is trained on past energy usage data, and it forecasts future consumption patterns. This can be extremely valuable for organizations aiming to optimize their energy usage, plan for future demand, and potentially reduce energy waste.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed and normalized to ensure effective training of the LSTM model.
- **LSTM Network**: The model is built using multiple LSTM layers with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. The architecture is designed to capture the temporal dependencies in the data.

### Why This Project Matters:
- **Energy Optimization**: Accurate energy consumption predictions can help organizations make better decisions regarding energy consumption, reduce costs, and contribute to sustainability.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: This project demonstrates the power of LSTM models in handling time series data and forecasting future trends, a key technique in various industries such as energy, finance, and healthcare.

### Technologies Used:
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: To build and train the LSTM model.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
